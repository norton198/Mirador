## Specific Interactions

### 0. Manage Taskbar Visibility Manually
- **Implementation:** Use system functions to manually control the taskbar’s visibility, overriding Windows' default behavior.
- **Status:** ✔️ Implemented

### 1. Hide the Taskbar with a Double-Click
- **Implementation:** Detect a double-click event on the taskbar and initiate the hiding.
- **Considerations:** Ensure the double-click is distinguished from single clicks to avoid accidental hides.
- **Status:** ✔️ Implemented ⚠️ Experimental

### 2. Unhide the Taskbar by Dragging Upwards from the Bottom of the Screen
- **Implementation:** Add logic to monitor drag events from the bottom edge of the screen and unhide the taskbar when an upward drag is detected.
- **Considerations:** Make sure the drag threshold is user-friendly and prevents accidental unhiding.
- **Status:** ❌ Not Started

### 3. Unhide the Taskbar When the Cursor is Positioned in the Bottom Corners of the Screen
- **Implementation:** Track cursor position and unhide the taskbar when the cursor is in predefined corner areas at the bottom of the screen.
- **Considerations:** Define the exact dimensions of the corners to ensure a balance between usability and accidental activation.
- **Status:** ✔️ Implemented ⚠️ Experimental

### 4. Temporarily Show the Taskbar When There Are Notifications
- **Implementation:** Monitor system notifications and temporarily display the taskbar to alert users.
- **Considerations:** Determine the duration for which the taskbar remains visible and how it re-hides after the notification is addressed.
- **Status:** ❌ Not Started

### 5. Lock and Unlock the Taskbar Autohide Feature with a Double-Click
- **Implementation:** Allow users to lock the taskbar in place (prevent autohide) or unlock it (enable autohide) with a double-click.
- **Considerations:** Provide some kind of visual feedback to indicate the current state (locked or unlocked) of the taskbar.
- **Status:** ❌ Not Started

### 6. Hide/Unhide Using a Shortcut Key Press (Shift + Tab)
- **Implementation:** Assign the key combination `Shift + Tab` to toggle the taskbar's visibility.
- **Considerations:** Ensure this combination avoids conflicts with existing shortcuts and allows easy toggling without interfering with other tasks.
